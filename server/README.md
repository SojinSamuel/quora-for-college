### ‚ú® Questions Routes

**üö© 1. `/api/v1/questions`**

Gets all the questions in the database. The typical response looks like

*Example 1:*
An ideal request will look like
`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/questions`

And ideal response will look like
```json
{
    "status": "Success",
    "result": 3,
    "data": {
        "questions": [
            {
                "_id": "61dd4b66875fa2ba15492c65",
                "userQuestioner": "Kaiwalya Koparkar",
                "questionTitle": "This is a question 1",
                "questionDescription": "This is the description of the question",
                "questionTag": "Courses",
                "upvotes": 10,
                "downvotes": 3,
                "answers": [
                    "61dd46f03cecd228e9df643a",
                    "61dd46f03cecd228e9df6439"
                ],
                "id": "61dd4b66875fa2ba15492c65"
            },
            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }
}

```

**üö© 2. `/api/v1/questions/<question id>`**

Gets specific question from large questions data. The question id here is given by the database.

*Example 1:*
An ideal request will look like
`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/questions/61dd4b66875fa2ba15492c65`

And ideal respons will look like
```json
{
    "status": "Success",
    "data": {
        "question": {
            "_id": "61dd4b66875fa2ba15492c65",
            "userQuestioner": "Kaiwalya Koparkar",
            "questionTitle": "This is a question 1",
            "questionDescription": "This is the description of the question",
            "questionTag": "Courses",
            "upvotes": 10,

            "answers": [
                "61dd46f03cecd228e9df643a",
                "61dd46f03cecd228e9df6439"
            ],
            "__v": 0,
            "id": "61dd4b66875fa2ba15492c65"
        }
    }
}
```

**üö© 3. `/api/v1/questions?page=<page-no>&limit=<no-of questions>`**

This will give you no-of question provided in *limit* field and you can increment the page no to get the next *limit* frame data.

*Example 1:*
An ideal request will look like (PAGE 1)
`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/questions?page=1&limit=1`
And ideal respons will look like
```json
{
    "status": "Success",
    "result": 1,
    "data": {
        "questions": [
            {
                "_id": "61dd4b66875fa2ba15492c65",
                "userQuestioner": "Kaiwalya Koparkar",
                "questionTitle": "This is a question 1",
                "questionDescription": "This is the description of the question",
                "questionTag": "Courses",
                "upvotes": 10,
                "downvotes": 3,
                "answers": [
                    "61dd46f03cecd228e9df643a",
                    "61dd46f03cecd228e9df6439"
                ],
                "id": "61dd4b66875fa2ba15492c65"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

*Example 2:*
An ideal request will look like (PAGE 3)
`http://localhost:8080/api/v1/questions?page=3&limit=1`
And ideal respons will look like (As there are only 13 questions and we are showing 5 per page)
```json
{
    "status": "Success",
    "result": 1,
    "data": {
        "questions": [
            {
                "_id": "61dd4b66875fa2ba15492c67",
                "userQuestioner": "Kaiwalya Koparkar",
                "questionTitle": "This is a question 3",
                "questionDescription": "This is the description of the question",
                "questionTag": "Courses",
                "upvotes": 15,
                "downvotes": 0,
                "answers": [
                    "61dd46f03cecd228e9df643a",
                    "61dd46f03cecd228e9df6439"
                ],
                "id": "61dd4b66875fa2ba15492c67"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

And ideal respons will look like
